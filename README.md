# Quickstart Summary

A small work in progress repository that can spit out a quickstart page when given the documentation of a library, language, or repository using AI. 

## Usage
An [OpenAI api key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) is necessary to run this program. Once you have the api key you can enter it as an environment variable.
For the time being the best way to use this code is to simply download the repository and run the python script. It will prompt you to give a link to the documentation

## To-Do
- Add ability to run the script as a command in the command line
- Increase focus on important parts of docs
- Increase amount of documentation pages it will read efficiently
- Add ability to read from files
